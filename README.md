# 🕹️ Introduction

This is where I store my pygame demos and projects. Pygame might not be the most popular game engine, but I find it very fun to put together small demos with it. By sharing my projects here, I hope that other people might find inspiration from my code.

# 🚀 Projects

- 🫧 *Aim Trainer* is a simple aim trainer where you click on bubbles. I made this to test the mouse functionality in pygame.  You can play it [here](https://tobiasmelbo.itch.io/pygame-aim-trainer).
- ⚛️ *Grunnstofftreneren* is a game for learning the norwegian names of the elements in the periodic table based on symbol and atomic number. You can play it [here](https://tobiasmelbo.itch.io/grunnstofftreneren)

# 🛠️ Tools
I use [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) for building the games, [pymunk](https://github.com/viblo/pymunk) for some of the physics and [pygbag](https://github.com/pygame-web/pygbag) to make the games playable in a browser.
